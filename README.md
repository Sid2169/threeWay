# Three-Way Battle Game: Old Gen vs. New Gen 🎮

This is an interactive web-based game inspired by the classic "Rock-Paper-Scissors" but with a unique twist! Instead of simple choices, you select legendary characters from the Old Gen or New Gen to battle it out.

## Features ✨
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Fully interactive UI where users can select their team members and challenge the computer's team.

- **Scorekeeping**: Tracks scores for both teams after each round.
- **Round System**: Updates the round counter dynamically to keep the gameplay engaging.
- **Stylish Design**: Engaging animations and hover effects for character selection.
